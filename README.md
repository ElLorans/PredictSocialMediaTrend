# PredictSocialMediaTrend
Can we predict Social Media Trends?

Project conducted during ESSEC's Accenture Chair for Bloom Social Analytics.
We investigated the best model to forecast engagement and document creations over 103 topics from 3 social medias: Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Smoothing the data using a moving average of order 7 and then using a SARIMAX model with order 7,0,4 proved to be the best result. This repository provides the code for the final and all the tested models.
